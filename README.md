*INTRODUCTION:

THIS PROJECT IS A PYTHON APPLICATION THAT EXTRACTS INCIDENTS DATA FROM A PDF FILE, STORES IT IN A DATABASE, AND PROVIDES FUNCTIONS TO POPULATE AND RETRIEVE INCIDENT INFORMATION.


*FUNCTIONS OVERVIEW:

FETCHINCIDENTS(URL): FETCHES A PDF FROM A GIVEN URL AND RETURNS A BYTE BUFFER OF THE CONTENTS.
EXTRACTINCIDENTS(BUFFER): EXTRACTS INCIDENT DATA FROM THE PROVIDED PDF BUFFER. INCIDENT DATA IS PARSED FROM TEXT IN THE PDF.
CREATEDB(): CREATES AN SQLITE DATABASE WITH A TABLE TO STORE INCIDENT INFORMATION.
POPULATEDB(CONNECTION, INCIDENTS): POPULATES THE SQLITE DATABASE WITH A LIST OF INCIDENT RECORDS.
STATUS(CONNECTION): PRINTS THE INCIDENT COUNTS GROUPED BY NATURE OF THE INCIDENT.


*APPROACH:

THE MAIN GOAL OF THE PROJECT IS TO FETCH INCIDENT REPORTS FROM PDFS, EXTRACT THE RELEVANT INFORMATION, AND STORE THIS DATA IN AN SQLITE DATABASE FOR FURTHER QUERYING.

*DATABASE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:

CREATING DATABASE: I IMPLEMENTED AN SQLITE DATABASE TO STORE INCIDENT DATA IN A STRUCTURED FORMAT. THIS INCLUDES COLUMNS FOR DATE, INCIDENT NUMBER, LOCATION, NATURE OF INCIDENT, AND ORI.
DATA POPULATION: INCIDENT DATA IS EXTRACTED FROM A PDF FILE AND THEN INSERTED INTO THE SQLITE DATABASE.

*REQUIRED INSTALLATION COMMANDS:
PIP INSTALL PYPDF
PIP INSTALL PYTEST


*HOW TO RUN THE CODE:
TO RUN THIS PROJECT, YOU CAN USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS:

PIPENV RUN PYTHON PROJECT0/MAIN.PY --INCIDENTS "PDF URL"

TO RUN THE TESTCASES:

PIPENV RUN PYTHON -M PYTEST


*ASSUMPTIONS:

THE PDF FORMAT IS STRUCTURED CONSISTENTLY.
INCIDENT NATURES WILL BE TEXTUALLY SIMILAR ENOUGH TO GROUP.
INCIDENT DATA CAN BE PROPERLY PARSED FROM THE CONTENTS OF THE PDF USING BASIC STRING OPERATIONS.

*KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES:

PDF PARSING: THE PDF PARSING MIGHT FAIL IF THE STRUCTURE OF THE PDF CHANGES OR IS TOO COMPLEX.
INCIDENT EXTRACTION: EXTRACTING DATA FROM PDF IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE FORMAT, SO ANY CHANGES TO THE PDF STRUCTURE CAN CAUSE ERRORS.
